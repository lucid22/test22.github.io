    <div data-aos="fade-left" class="Introtext"><p>Portgas D. Ace,[12] born as Gol D. Ace[6] and nicknamed "Fire Fist" Ace,[4] was the sworn older brother of Luffy[7] and Sabo,[13] and the son of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger and his lover, Portgas D. Rouge.[14] Ace was adopted by Monkey D. Garp as wished by Roger to him before his birth.[15] Ace was the 2nd division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates[2] and one-time captain of the Spade Pirates.[3] He also is the central character from Ace's Great Blackbeard Search Cover Page Serial. Hunted by the World Government for his lineage, Ace was captured and sentenced to death, which resulted in the Battle of Marineford in an all out clash of powers. Ace was freed,[16] but he sacrificed his life to protect Luffy from Akainu.[17] Ace's death ultimately proved to be the catalyst leading to Luffy training for two years to become strong enough to protect his friends, paving the way for the second half of the series.</p>

    <p>Ace wore an open-front shirt until he received Whitebeard's tattoo - afterwards, he stopped wearing anything over his upper body except when on winter or desert islands due to the weather requirements. He wore black boots, black knee-length shorts with an eyelet-studded orange belt, and a blue pouch belted around his left leg. He also wore a short second belt with a large red "A" on the silver buckle over his right hip, but left it unfastened and threaded the free end along the back of his shorts. A dagger in a green sheath hung at his left hip. On Ace's left arm, he wore a Log Pose and a red and white striped bracelet around his wrist, an orange elbow guard, and his "ASCE" tattoo. He wore a red beaded necklace and an orange hat with two blue smileys, one frowning and one smiling, and a string of red beads sitting above the rim. Two long orange side straps hung down sides of his hat and met at a large medallion of a bull's skull with orange tassels. Unfortunately, Ace lost his trademark hat, which he already had when he began his journey as a pirate, on Banaro Island as a result of his duel with Blackbeard. His knife was also apparently confiscated, as he no longer had it in his next appearance as a prisoner at Impel Down. The tattoo upon his back that he took so much pride in was later destroyed by the same blow that eventually led to his death. However, at his grave, Ace's hat and knife were placed at his tombstone—either they were retrieved, or they were duplicates in Ace's possession</p>
    </div>
    <div data-aos="zoom-in-right" data-aos-offset="300" class="phytitle"><h1>Physical Abilities</h1></div>
    <a name=PhysicalAbilities> </a>
    <p data-aos="zoom-in" class="phytext">Aside from the powers granted by the Devil Fruit he consumed, Ace possessed immense physical strength and endurance which he attained from the extremely rigorous training in the harsh environment of Mt. Colubo mainly from hunting and fighting wild beast since childhood. His incredible physical prowess were supplemented by his extraordinary fighting skills. Even in his early childhood, he was able to beat some local thugs who spoke ill of his father "half to death" and during his first meeting with Luffy, he was also shown sitting on top of a huge bull he killed with his staff. He could also easily break a giant tree with a single kick. In his childhood, before he acquired the Mera Mera no Mi, Ace was able to best Luffy in every single sparring match, despite Luffy's untrained Gomu Gomu no Mi abilities.

      Ace demonstrated his strength during his battle with Blackbeard: he was able to take Blackbeard's punches, which were so powerful that the first made Ace cough up blood and the second nearly broke his neck, and retaliate quickly afterwards. Van Augur noted that, as expected of the Whitebeard Pirates 2nd division commander, Ace's basic combat skills were quite formidable even without his Devil Fruit powers.
      
      He fought equally with Jinbe in the past; they nearly killed each other in a fight that lasted for five days straight. Ace then survived a battle with Whitebeard that took place immediately after, showing immense stamina and durability. He was one of the few people to be able to take a "baptizing" in boiling water in Impel Down without flinching, which is considered an impressive feat.</p>

    <p class="deviltext">Ace ate the Devil Fruit <a href="https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Mera_Mera_no_Mi"> Mera Mera no Mi</a>, a <b>Logia-type</b> fruit that allows him to become the element of fire and control the flames from his body, giving him his reputation as "Fire Fist Ace". Ace displayed his immense power by destroying a handful of Baroque Works ships with ease.[18] His main style is to launch columns of fire by punching, with his signature "Fire Fist". He is also immune to normal physical strikes, all of which will simply phase through his fire-composed body.

      He traversed the seas in a one-man boat that seems to have been specifically designed for him, propelling it with flames from his feet.
      
      Ace also had practical uses for his Devil Fruit abilities, as he would heat up any fish he would find in the seas for his crew when they had no food to eat.
      
      He skillfully sent his boat underwater as he leaped over the Billions fleet, timing it precisely so that it emerged underneath him just before he hit the water on the other side. Later after his death, it was revealed that Ace's burning fists also had the power to annihilate entire cities</p>
      
        <div class="hakititle"><h1> Haki </h1></div>
     <a name= Haki></a>
     <p class="hakitext">Ace's Haki had been described by Shanks and Benn Beckman to be fiery in nature, to the point that Ace’s very presence was able to stop blizzards on an island for as long as he was there.[20] As such, when he turned up on Drum Island, no snow fell at all on the island for an entire day.[1] Haoshoku Haki Ace unleashes Haoshoku Haki for the first time. Ace possessed Haoshoku Haki, which he initially had no conscious control over. He first demonstrated the ability at 10 years of age when he rendered the Bluejam Pirates except for Bluejam unconscious after an outburst of rage.[21] He later gained knowledge of the power, as he recognized it when Luffy used it at the Battle of Marineford. He was never seen using this Haki apart from during his childhood, save for in the video games (such as during the activation of his Kizuna Rush in Pirate Warriors 3). Busoshoku Haki It was stated in One Piece novel A that Ace could use Busoshoku Haki. Upon awakening it, he was capable of fighting on equal grounds with Vice Admiral Draw with Busoshoku Haki.[22] However, it is not known how proficient he was in using it.</p>

      <p class="pasttext"> Ace, Luffy, and Sabo become brothers. The trio continued their adventures across the island, becoming more well-known to an increasing number of people. They hunted animals and fought each other to grow stronger. One day, they snuck into the Goa Kingdom, where they ate at a restaurant and broke out without paying. As they were running away, Ace and Luffy saw a man calling out to Sabo, but Sabo denied any connection to him. However, when they returned to the woods, Ace and Luffy forced Sabo to tell them the truth. Sabo revealed that the man was his father and he was the son of nobles, but left that life behind. The trio then proclaimed their dreams as they plotted their future pirating lives</p>

     <p class="marinetext">Ace was put on his knees at the execution platform while the Marines awaited the arrival of Whitebeard. To start the anticipated event, Sengoku asked Ace who his father was. , though at a further cost to the giant.[62] With the battle resuming, Marco attempted to rescue Ace, but was punched away by Garp.[63] Ace then put his head down and started weeping as he saw all the pirates in front of him being dedicated to saving his life, which many others had considered worthless, and he watched as Luffy unleashed a great cry after receiving a dose of hormones from Emporio Ivankov. Although Whitebeard showed weakness from his age and was punished by the Admirals,[14] Ace watched as his captain continued to press on. The executioners, having returned, raised their blades to try to execute Ace again, but they were suddenly knocked out by Luffy unleashing Haoshoku Haki.[64] Ace is freed. Ace sat stunned by Luffy's Haki before he watched as Inazuma created a ramp for Luffy to run to the execution platform,[65] and although Garp confronted Luffy, the Vice Admiral was taken out in one punch as Luffy reached Ace. Sengoku then prepared to attack Luffy with his Devil Fruit power as Kizaru destroyed the key to Ace's handcuffs, but after regaining consciousness, the nearby Galdino was ordered to protect Ace with a wax barrier while Luffy absorbed Sengoku's punch. The force of the punch caused the execution platform to fall, and the Marines fired cannonballs at Ace and Luffy, but after Galdino made a wax key to unlock Ace's handcuffs, Ace was freed and used his Devil Fruit powers to shield himself and Luffy from the explosion.[66] Ace takes the blow intended for Luffy by Akainu. After landing on the ground, Ace and Luffy quickly went to work fighting off the Marines in tandem. When Aokiji stepped in, Ace met the Admiral's ice powers with his fire. However, the brothers were taken aback as Whitebeard proclaimed to his crew that he would stay behind on Marineford while they escaped.[67] Ace initially did not move after this proclamation, and Whitebeard asked him if he had been a good father, which Ace resolutely affirmed. Ace and Luffy then ran off with Jinbe, but Admiral Akainu stepped in, saying that Whitebeard was a failure and that his crew were scum and cowards. Angered at Akainu's statements about Whitebeard, Ace went back and attacked him, but was overwhelmed due to Akainu's magma fruit being superior to his own fire. Akainu then ambushed an unsuspecting Luffy, and Ace stepped in front of the Admiral, whose magma fist went through his torso and burned up his insides.[68] Ace passes on. With Ace still alive in the immediate aftermath, Akainu prepared to attack him again, but was intercepted by Jinbe. The dying Ace fell into Luffy's arms, and he recollected how he had first been given a place with Luffy, Sabo, and Dadan as he remembered a childhood otherwise filled with torment and persecution. .[69]</p>
